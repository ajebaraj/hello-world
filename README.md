If you are package maintainer, it's time to start porting (if you haven't already). Here is an in-depth guide Porting to Python 3 and the official porting HOWTO. If you are not able to give the time needed, please seek for help from the community by announcing your need for help on blogs, IRC, mailing lists, etc.

If you are user of the package, send a friendly note to the package maintainer. Or fork it, and send a pull request to help move the project towards Python 3 support.

How do you identify Python 3 support?
